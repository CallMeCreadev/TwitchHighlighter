This Program was a working tool that would get a list of timestamps where chat interaction was at its highest.
Purpose was to find moments where chat was spamming certain phrases and then identify those timestamps IE: When was chat spamming "KEKW"  or "LUL" the most.

To use the program update main.py with the name of your chat.json file and update the tokens that are being searched for in main.py.
