This Program was a working tool that would get a list of timestamps where chat interaction was at its highest.
Purpose was to find moments where chat was spamming certain phrases and then identify those timestamps IE: When was chat spamming "KEKW"  or "LUL" the most.

To use the program update file_path variable in main.py with the name of your chat.json file and update the patterns variable for what you want searched for in main.py.
